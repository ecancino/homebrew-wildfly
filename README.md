# Homebrew wildfly Installation for old version


This repo is created for brew user to download older version of wildly server.
Because **wildfl** does not meet the popularity criteria to be part of homebrew family.

To install , simply do the following

```shell
brew tap ecancino/homebrew-wildfly
brew install ecancino/homebrew-wildfly/wildfly-as
```

Hope this is helpful :)
